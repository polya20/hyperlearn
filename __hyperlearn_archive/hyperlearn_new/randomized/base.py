# Sketching methods from David Woodruff.

###
def sketch(n, p, k = 10, method = "left"):
    """
    Produces a CountSketch matrix which is similar in nature to
    the Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss Transform (eps Fast-JLT) as shown
    in Sklearn. But, as shown by David Woodruff, "Sketching as a 
    Tool for Numerical Linear Algebra" [arxiv.org/abs/1411.4357],
    super fast matrix multiplies can be done. Notice a difference
    is HyperLearn's  K = min(n, p)/2, but david says k^2/eps is
    needed (too memory taxing). [Added 4/12/18] [Edited 14/12/18]

    Parameters
    -----------
    X:              Data matrix.
    k:              (auto, int). Auto is min(n, p) / 2
    method:         (left, right). Left is S @ X. Right X @ S.
    
    Returns
    -----------
    (Sketch Matrix S or indices)
